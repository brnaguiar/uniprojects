# Ciber-Rato challenge

Development of a robotic agent to command a simulated mobile robot in order to overcome a set of robotic challenges, involving different navigation skills:

1. Control:  The objective of this challenge is to control the movement of a robot throughan unknown closed circuit as fast as possible and without colliding with the surroundingwalls.

2.  Mapping: The objective of this challenge is to explore an unknown maze in order to extractits map.  (No penalties for collisions.)

3.  Planning:  The objective of this challenge is to explore an unknown maze in order to locatetwo  target spots  and compute  a best closed  path that  allows to  visit both target  spotsstarting and ending in the starting spot.  (No penalties for collisions.)

## To run:

sh startCx 

cd agent
