<content>Frank Ocean (born October 28, 1987) is an American singer/songwriter and member of the gleefully-hedonistic hip-hop collective OFWGKTA. He was born Christopher Edwin Cooksey (later legally changed to Breaux) in Long Beach, California, and moved to New Orleans with his family as a young child. He has helped pen tracks for Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy, and Beyoncé. In 2011, Ocean released his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, for free via his Tumblr.&#10;&#10;After high school, Ocean enrolled in the University of New Orleans to study English. However, he had to suspend his studies due to Hurricane Katrina and its devastating effects that took place in the summer of 2005. His home and personal recording facility were destroyed, and after briefly studying at another college, he dropped out and moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a music career. Ocean joined Los Angeles-based collective OFWGKTA, whose members he met through mutual friends, in 2009. At the end of 2009, he met Tricky Stewart, who helped Ocean sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as an artist; however, he was initially unable to build a successful relationship with the company. In an April 2011 interview, Ocean intimated that his relationship with Def Jam had strengthened since the release of his mixtape. &#10;&#10;On April 28, 2011, Ocean was arrested on unspecified charges by the LAPD, and was released on the morning after on April 29, 2011. Ocean joined his OFWGKTA bandmates for the first time on tour from May 12 to May 19, 2011. On May 31, 2011, Def Jam released the single Novacane on iTunes soon followed by Swim Good Taken from his mixtape Nostalgia, ULTRA. Ocean&apos;s first &quot;proper&quot; album, Channel Orange was released on July 17, 2012. On April 23, 2015, he legally changed his name to &quot;Frank Ocean&quot; after attempting to do so a few times in the previous several years.&#10;&#10;In 2016, he released the visual album Endless alongside his second studio album Blonde, following several years of delays. &quot;Blonde&quot; debuted at number one in the United States and the United Kingdom.&#10;&#10;In 2017, Ocean released several singles, including &quot;Chanel&quot; and &quot;Lens&quot; through his Blonded Radio show, and made several appearances on other songs by artists like Calvin Harris, A$AP Mob, and Tyler, the Creator. The next year, he released his cover of &quot;Moon River&quot;, a popular 1960s song from the film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s&quot;. At the end of 2019, he released two more singles: &quot;DHL&quot; and &quot;In My Room&quot;. At the beginning of April 2020, &quot;Dear April&quot; and &quot;Cayendo&quot; were released, the latter&apos;s title translating to &quot;Falling&quot; in English. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
