<content>Calvin Harris (born Adam Richard Wiles; January 17,  1984 in Dumfries, Scotland), is a Scottish singer, songwriter and record producer. He was born and grew up in Dumfries, Scotland. His interest in electronic music surfaced in his early teenage years, producing his first bedroom demo by the age of 15. &#10;&#10;His first album I Created Disco was released on 18 June 2007. The album contained up-tempo electroclash songs that were influenced by music from the 1980s. To promote &apos;I Created Disco&apos;, Harris embarked on a tour of the UK, supporting Faithless and Groove Armada.&#10;&#10;The first release from the album was Vegas on limited edition vinyl and the first charted single released from the album was Acceptable In The 80&apos;s, a tribute to the style and culture of the decade.

The fourth release from the album was Merrymaking At My Place however it only reached #43 in the UK chart.&#10;&#10;&apos;Merrymaking At My Place&apos; caused Harris some un-needed press, as the song and video promoted filming parties at teenagers&apos; houses, and placing them on Youtube.&#10;&#10;Harris&apos; second studio album Ready For The Weekend was released on August 17, 2009 in the United Kingdom. The first single, I&apos;m Not Alone, was exclusively performed in Sydney, on New Year&apos;s Eve. The single was released in April 2009. The new single debuted on BBC Radio 1 on Friday 23 January 2009, on the &apos;Pete Tong&apos; radio show. The song featured on his MySpace with the infamous spoiler, which repeated the phrase &apos;I Am Your Nan&apos; in a robotic voice. It debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #1 on Easter Sunday on downloads alone. &#10;&#10;Harris rose to international prominence in 2012 with the release of his third studio album, 18 Months. Topping the UK charts, the album became his first to chart on the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 19.

The latter became an international success, giving Harris his first US number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. Harris released his fourth studio album, Motion, in November 2014.
